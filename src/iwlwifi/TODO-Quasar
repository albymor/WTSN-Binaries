- New flush API, waiting for FW (Lotem) - Liad BU

	https://git-amr-3.devtools.intel.com/gerrit/#/c/96905/15

TODO list - order by priority:
! for can do now
IF for can build the infrastructure now

!- Support trace command for all the API changes (Johannes->Sharon)
!- Change rate configurations in mac command (new reqs from Elad Oren) (Dreyfuss)
- Blocked by FW:
	- Missing RX queue config APIs. Once we have it remove the disablement of multi queue in
	  iwl_mvm_sync_rx_queues_internal and in iwl_mvm_up (Liad, Ido A)
IF	- When agg manager is offloaded to FW - we will have to init reorder buffer from
	  DP (like FMAC). (Luca, Ido A, Ronni)
	- Moving to 32 stations (Ido A, Liad)
	  need to change IWL_MVM_STATION_COUNT to 32, but in iwl_mvm_find_free_sta_id make sure to not
	  allow over sixteen for no-Qsr.
	- Beacon template API should go back to all HWs bases on TLV (Eli T, rate configurations  -re-requisite, team)
	- TX fragmentation offload - missing configuration API to pass from mac80211 to FW (Liad, Ido A)
	- RTS threshold - missing configuration API to pass from mac80211 to FW (Liad, Ido A)
	- Aux station config in CDB - should be done by FW (Moti, Eran R)
	- Integration with TLC offload (there is new configuration command) (Gregory)
IF	- Optimiziation (Shahar):
	  Once FW supports configuring command queue size in context info (now it is hard coded in FW)
	  we would want have the command queue CB in size of 32 and avoid the whole sliding window
	  logic. (Liad, blocked by Lotem from Ido A's team)
	- RSS configuration
- For D3 integration we will need (Dreyfuss):
IF	- Change command 0xed to be first on resume.
	- Add sta_id in wowlan config in order to enable the driver to indicate the station
	index for whom the FW needs take control instead of driver.
	This needs an API change that needs to be coordinated with Eran's team.
- Open system:
	- FW restart flow - undefined (No requirements right now, Danny A)
	- Wowlan

CDB - Moti:
!- Allow 4 bindings total, max 3 per LMAC
!- Expose CDB to upper stack
!- Channel selection \ AP selection
!- Statistics API must change to be common between CDB and non CDB FW
!- Quota allocation per band

11ax - Liad - tracked already in JIRA.

Future - Step A0:
IF- RX path offloads (reorder, duplicate and replay)
IF- new HW structures
IF- new init flow
IF- Ethernet format
- TKIP offload
